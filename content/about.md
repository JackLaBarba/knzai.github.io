Despite my cheeky domain and page title choices, I am very much a human, with decades of experience as a software engineer, engineering manager, and tech executive.

As a manager I try to be warm and approachable and create a space of safety and open communication so we can still set team expectations very high without also creating anxiety, a constant sense of being under the gun, and burnout leading to retention problems by doing so by fiat. I approach all situations with my team from a place of curiousity and frequently have been able to turn around performance issues that would traditionally have led to a PIP and loss of talent. I beleive strongly in servant leadership and that my place is not to make technical decisions for them, but to help them grow into a team that can make the right decisions as often as possible, and learn from the wrong ones when not.

As an engineer, I'm very much a [T shaped polyglot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills), having professionally worked with many languages (check the sidebar on my resume) and having 15+ years experience with Ruby and other web related languages. I remember the [browser wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars) and all the horrible work-arounds we had to use. The first language I genuinely liked was the Lisp my college professor adored and made us write an interpeter for. This probably influenced my attempts to make Javascript do more than it could at that time (pre ajax/xmlhttprequest), and I still have a softspot for it. After a spate of ASP/PHP/python(Zope, uggh)/Java(Spring and j2ee, double uggh), I finally discovered Ruby and that become a staple of my career for well over the next decade.

Lately, I've been enoying Rust for side projects, such as parsing CGA/EGA binary files from games ([cega](/cega)) or publishing this site with [zola](https://www.getzola.org/) and thus learning all about Github Actions while deploying it [zola-build](/zola-build).

I have a somewhat unusual predilection in that I enjoy maintaining code I didn't write (or that I did). Give me something to refactor and improve, to streamline, to add CI/CD to, and to otherwise improve and I'll happily plug away it with my brain cycling in the background and coming up with new tooling to help. I'll tinker with getting a bunch of bash scripts (that's all GH actions really are at their core) just so for deployment. I'll massage the API of the CLI till the parameters are optimal.

I have a strong belief that more diverse teams lead to better results. There's been so much said on this topic, including studies on the matter, that I don't know that I need to get into it.


Autodidact par excellence, I taught myself to read at 2 1/2 with the audio tape read alongs for the [Serendipity childrens book series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serendipity_\(book_series\)) and to program at 8 from computing magazine [type in games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type-in_program) of the 80s.

In high school I grew more interested in chemistry and chemical engineering after reading the works of [Erik K Drexler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._Eric_Drexler) who made it seem like molecular nanotechnology was just around the corner. It wasn't until my collegete attempts at Organic Chemistry that I reconsidered and realized there was an interest and faculty I had all along that might make an interesting field.
