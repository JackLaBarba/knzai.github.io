<img src="{{resize_image(path='/assets/images/me.jpg', width=200, height=200) }}"/>With over 20 years of experience in software engineering and management, I have expertise in various high-compliance sectors such as fin/ed/health/gov tech and leading the development of high-throughput, low-latency, low-downtime systems. I particularly enjoy management of cross-functional teams and cross-team collabs.

As a queer trans woman, I strongly believe that diverse teams yield better results. In my leadership role, I strive to bring unique perspectives and prioritize creating a safe, communicative environment while also setting high team expectations. I believe in servant leadership and empowering my team to make the right decisions. I have a track record of addressing performance issues without resorting to punitive measures (an rare skill in tech), and I work hard to earn loyalty, which significantly improves team cohesion and retention.

As an engineer, I am a T-shaped polyglot: I have worked with almost every widely used web production language of the last 20 years and have particularly been working with Ruby on Rails for almost that entire time. My current other favorites include Rust (supplmented by by bash and GitHub Actions) for dealing with 80s game file formats: eventually I plan to rebuild an engine for Ultima 1-3. I'm also one of those weirdos who actually likes maintaining and improving others code, infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines.

In addition to my professional background, I am an autodidact with a passion for learning, which began at a young age when I taught myself to read by 2 1/2 years old from [Serendipity books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serendipity_(book_series)) author read-alongs, and to program at 8 years old from [type in programs in old computing magazines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type-in_program).

I was also a competitive mogul skiier with ambitions of the Olympics and hoped to save the world with nanotechnology (the 90s were an ambitious era), before my O-Chem course foiled that dream and returned to computing. My diverse interests have led me on a unique journey that has contributed to my well-rounded perspective in both technology and beyond.
